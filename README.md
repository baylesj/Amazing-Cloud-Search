OkayCloudSearch

My project was utilizing AmazingCloudSearch, but I did not have any success using
it with my cloudsearch cluster on the 2013 api version.

So... I bring you OkayCloudSearch. It preserves the rich history of no tests, but the parser
is updated to use a lucene parser instead of structured parsing.

Other changes include removal of irritating spelling mistakes, refactoring methods to
be a reasonable size, and other minor improvements.

Hope you enjoy <3
